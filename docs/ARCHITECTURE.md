# ARCHITECTURE.md — how this codebase is organized

Last reviewed: 2026-10-06. Agents: update this file whenever structure, data model, or decisions change.

## Stack
React 18 + TypeScript (strict) + Vite 5 + Tailwind 3 + Supabase (Postgres, Auth, RLS) + Recharts + lucide-react. PWA via `public/sw.js` and `public/manifest.json`.

## How the app flows
`App.tsx` decides what to render, in order:
1. loading → spinner
2. no user → `LandingView`, or `AuthView` if the URL hash is `#login` / `#signup`
3. user but no store → `OnboardingView`
4. user + store → app shell (Navbar + Sidebar) showing the tab from the URL hash: `#sell`, `#inventory`, `#sales`, `#audit`, `#analytics`

## Data model (Supabase)
Tables: `stores`, `custom_attribute_definitions`, `products`, `sales`, `sale_payments`, `sale_items`, `refunds`, `register_closures`, `stock_movements`.
- One owner per store (`stores.owner_user_id`). RLS is enabled on every table; policies restrict rows to the store owner via `is_store_owner()`.
- Multi-step operations are atomic Postgres functions: `create_sale_transaction`, `process_refund_transaction`, `void_sale_transaction`, `close_register_transaction`. Call them via `supabase.rpc` from `services/api.ts`.

## Data access
- Views call `api.*` methods. Only `services/api.ts` talks to Supabase.
- `api.ts` also contains pure analytics helpers (`getMetricTrends`, `getRevenueTrendData`, `getHourlySalesData`, `getStockHealthData`, `getSmartRestockSuggestions`, `getTopFavorites`) and `seedDemo`.

## Local mock mode
If `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are missing, `AuthContext` and `api.ts` fall back to `localStorage` for development only. This is blocked in production mode. When Supabase is configured, queries throw explicit errors on failure rather than falling back silently.

## Design system
Tokens live in `tailwind.config.ts` under `agora.*` (bg, card, border, ink, terracotta, brass, sage, brick, gold). Fonts: Fraunces (serif headings), Inter (body). Shared look classes: `.ledger-card`, `.ledger-row`.

## Known issues (cleanup candidates, roughly by priority)
1. (Resolved in A4) Split `services/api.ts` into modular domain services (`products`, `sales`, `movements`, `settings`, `register`, `analytics`) re-exported via `api.ts` facade.
2. (Resolved in A3) Removed silent localStorage fallbacks on Supabase errors; queries now throw explicit errors.
3. (Resolved in A3) Retained Local Mock Mode strictly as a dev-only fallback when `.env` is unconfigured.
4. (Resolved in A5) Eliminated all `any` types and replaced native `alert()` / `confirm()` calls with `ConfirmModal` and inline error banners.
5. Hand-rolled hash navigation in `App.tsx`; a `landing` tab also exists inside the logged-in app. Production bundle is one 962 kB JS file (no code splitting).
6. `LandingView.tsx` is 685 lines in one file; the large views (Sell, Inventory, Analytics, Sales) are 450–510 lines each and load their own data inline.
7. (Resolved in A6) Purged `seedDemo()` out of `Navbar.tsx`; `Navbar.tsx` is now purely layout/navigation and user session controls.
8. Repo hygiene: `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` is committed though ignored; `.babelrc` references `next/babel` but this is a Vite project; no README, tests, linter, or formatter.
9. Naming: standardized product name to "Agora", package to "agora", and localStorage keys to "agora_*" (with legacy key fallback).
10. `index.html`: `user-scalable=no` blocks pinch-zoom (accessibility); canonical/OG URLs and image are placeholders.
11. Minor: `is_store_owner()` is `SECURITY DEFINER` without a fixed `search_path`.

## Decisions log
- 2026-10-06: A1 repo hygiene — untracked tsconfig.tsbuildinfo from git, removed unused .babelrc, and added project README.md.
- 2026-10-06: A2 naming — standardized product name to "Agora", package name to "agora", and local storage keys to "agora_*" (with automatic fallback migration for legacy shemsu_* keys).
- 2026-10-07: A3 mock mode & error handling — retained Local Mock Mode strictly for development without Supabase keys, and removed silent localStorage fallbacks when Supabase is configured.
- 2026-10-07: A4 domain split — modularized `src/services/` into domain-specific services with a unified `api` facade export.
- 2026-10-07: A5 types & modals — replaced all 14 `any` types with strict interfaces/unions, and replaced all 18 `alert()` / `confirm()` calls with inline error banners and a reusable `ConfirmModal`.
- 2026-10-07: A6 navbar refactor — removed `seedDemo()` and sample catalog buttons from `Navbar.tsx`; preserved `seedDemo` for onboarding and upcoming landing page demo flow.
